# light-in-skin-animation
An animation of light propagation in human skin with Hemangioma using pyxopto.

A working animation is in animation.ipynb.

## animation.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the simulation and visualization of light propagation in human skin with Hemangioma. It uses the pyxopto library and includes code, plots, and explanations for running and understanding the animation.
